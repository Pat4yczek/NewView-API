## 🌟 Overview
**NewView API** is a universal technological bridge connecting PCs and consoles with mobile devices. It enables the rapid creation of interactive "second screen" experiences, not only for video games (HUDs, inventories, dynamic maps) but also for professional desktop applications (control panels, production tools, and virtual stream decks).

## 🛠 Technical Core
- **Dual-Purpose Architecture:** Engineered for both AAA/Indie gaming ecosystems and professional productivity software.
- **PWA Integration:** Zero-install requirement. Instant connection via secure **QR Code** scanning.
- **Ultra-Low Latency:** High-performance communication via WebSockets over Local WiFi (LAN).
- **Engine Agnostic:** Seamless integration with C#, C++, Python, and proprietary game engines.

## 🛡 Security & Forensic Logging
Designed with enterprise-grade stability and security in mind:
- **Anti-Tamper Validation:** Every data packet undergoes rigorous server-side verification.
- **Forensic Records:** Upon detection of unauthorized access or validation failure, the system generates a security log including:
  - **Product ID & Model:** Accurate identification of the connected mobile hardware.
  - **Payload Capture:** Full recording of suspicious data for security audits.
  - **Device Fingerprinting:** Law-enforcement-ready metadata for forensic investigations.

## 💼 Business & Professional Services
As a registered sole trader, I provide end-to-end professional support for commercial implementations of NewView API:
1. **Custom UI/UX Design:** Bespoke mobile interface development tailored to your game or software's aesthetic.
2. **Technical Integration:** Implementing the protocol into proprietary engines or B2B software suites.
3. **Security Consulting:** System hardening and configuration of advanced telemetry modules.

*Open to industry grants (e.g., Epic MegaGrants), community funding, and B2B partnerships.*
