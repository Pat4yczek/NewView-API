# Minimalist PWA Boilerplate

A clean, professional foundation for Progressive Web Applications. This project follows a modular structure, separating logic, styles, and assets for maximum scalability.

## 🚀 Features
- **PWA Ready**: Includes `manifest.json` and `sw.js` for "Add to Home Screen" support.
- **Minimalist Aesthetic**: Sharp, high-contrast UI inspired by geometric shapes.
- **Optimized Structure**: Organized directories for CSS, JS, and Assets.

## 📁 Project Structure
- `index.html`: Main entry point.
- `sw.js`: Service Worker for offline support and caching.
- `manifest.json`: PWA configuration and icons.
- `/css`: Modern, clean stylesheets.
- `/js`: Modular JavaScript logic.
- `/assets`: Images, audio, and branding resources.

## 🛠 Setup
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a local server (e.g., Live Server in VS Code).
3. Deploy to GitHub Pages to test PWA installation on mobile.
